#MyFlix
***
This is my final project of Tealeaf Acaedemy. This project is like a clone of NetFlix by using rails. It focused on Test Driven Development(red-green-refactor) with Rspec, Capybara, Selenium and so on. It also involves a wide range of topics including background job, github flow, object composition, API wrapper and integrating with API like AWS, Mailgun Stripe.
